### Hello, friend. 
Hello there. My name is Alexander and now I'll tell you about myself.
I graduated from the Sukhoi State Technical University of Gomel, Engineer by radioelectronics, and after that I continued to study and received Master's degree in technical sciences. And now I am currently attending the RSSchool frontend course.

### About my work experience  
I worked as software engineer for the automated control system at the factory, but that's not at all the kind of programming that we learn in this course.

### Job responsibilities
My main job at the factory is programming industrial logic controllers. My normal workday consisted of troubleshooting and implementing new features. Sometimes, I'd to develop new software.

### Skills
My skills in frontend are based on the already completed material of the RS School course. I can't say that I remember all modules exactly. But I can solve similar problems much faster. My frontend skills (I think) are standard for a course student: HTML, CSS with SASS, GIT and JavaScript, also basic skill in NodeJS. To this knowledge, I can add the skills that I applied at my previous workplace: virtualization, networking (for example: VPN, building network), linux. I have knowledge with Pascal similar language, because I wrote on this language with ABB robot, and other industrial controller.
My english level is A2. This is Epam english test result in June 2022. 

### Pet project
The last few months, my main pet project has been studying at RS School. I started my way in frontend from stage 0 in December 2021. 
The most technically challenging for me in RS School was the Virtual Keyboard project. It took me a while to figure out how best to do this task. Some of the nuances of the work I still have a question. Since the assignments go one by one, I did not have the time and energy to solve this issue until now. That said, the Virtual Keyboard was also one of the most interesting assignments. I did not sleep much, because I could not stop to solve the problem. The issue I had, among other things, was the problem of switching the language.  
Other interesting tasks were the HTML Builder, and implementing JS in the Shelter project (like as slider, random picture). 
It was interesting because I was able to apply knowledge in programming in a real project.
Not all tasks I did the first time, but if I knew there was something that didn't work (by myself or when someone pointed it out to me on the cross check), I fixed it.  
There is task where I have difficulties - that is create a good design myself. I hope that I know the difference between good and bad design or usability,  but right now it's hard for me to do well myself.

### About my strengths.
Whats about my strengths?
I am responsible and independent. 
I can work hard. I can working with a team but I also enjoy working individually. I'm not a conflicted person. 
I'm honest. And I value my reputation.

### Interest and free time
One of my hobbies has always been my work. I liked what I was doing. The same thing happens now, when I work on tasks in the RS School.
Also, in my free time I liked to travel, I like bicycle, listen to podcasts, took part in the game like 'super quizz'.

### Why I chose programming
I really enjoy with programming: creating new programs, troubleshooting, solving complex problems with programs.

### In the end
I know exactly that I will become a software engineer, and I will do my best to reach my goal.

### Pet project
В последнее время главным моим проектом была учеба в RS School.  Я начал свой путь с этапа 0. 
Самым сложным в техническом плане, для меня, был проект Виртуальной клавиатуры. 
В начале программный код получился очень объемным и не очень стабильным. 
У меня не сразу получилось понять, как лучше всего сделать это задание. Некоторые нюансы работы у меня вызывают вопрос до сих пор. Т.к. задания идут один за одним, у меня не было времени и сил решить этот вопрос до сих пор. При этом Виртуальная клавиатура была и одним из самых интересных заданий. Я мало спал, потому что не мог остановиться решать task. Вопрос который у меня возник, помимо прочего, это проблема при переключении языка.
Очень интересными заданиями были  HTML Builder, и JS в Shelter project (slider? random picture). 
Не все задания я делал с первого раза, но если я знал, что где-то есть нерабочие элементы (сам или когда мне об том указывали на кросс-чеке), то я переделывал их.
Во frontend мне тяжело - это  придумать самому хороший дизайн. Я могу оценить удобство и дизайн уже готового решения и отличить (я надеюсь) хороший от плохого. Но придумать что-то красивое самому  - сейчас это сложно и долго для меня.

Not all tasks I did the first time, but if I knew there was something that didn't work (by myself or when someone pointed it out to me on the cross check), I redid it.
The hard part for me on the frontend is coming up with a good design myself. I can assess the usability and design of an existing solution and distinguish (I hope) good from bad. But to come up with something nice by myself - now it's hard and long for me.
