## Hello, friend. 
Hello there. My name is Alexander and now I'll tell you about myself.
I graduated from the Sukhoi State Technical University of Gomel, Engineer by radioelectronics, and after that I continued to study and received Master's degree in technical sciences. And now I am currently attending the RSSchool frontend course.

### About my work experience  
I worked as software engineer for the automated control system at the factory, but that's not at all the kind of programming that we learn in this course.

### Job responsibilities
My main job at the factory is programming industrial logic controllers. My normal workday consisted of troubleshooting and implementing new features. Sometimes, I'd to develop new software.
I liked the factory where I worked. There were a lot of good and smart people, who knew their job. And the work was interesting and exciting.

### Skills
My skills in frontend are based on the already completed material of the RS School course. I can't say that I remember all modules exactly. But I can solve similar problems much faster. My frontend skills are standard for a course student: HTML, CSS with SASS, GIT and JavaScript, also basic skill in NodeJS. To this knowledge, I can add the skills that I applied at my previous workplace: virtualization, networking (for example: VPN, building network), linux. Also I can make logic circuits quite well.
My english level is A2. This is Epam english test result in June 2022. I understand English quite well, but I still have difficulty with complex sentences.

### My strengths and weaknesses 
Let’s start talk to my weaknesses.
I can work on several tasks at the same time, but my efficiency decreases. 
I can't always give a good solution very quickly. However, if I thinking a little, I usually give very good solutions to problems.
Sometimes I have problem with my perfectionism.

### About my strengths.
Whats about my strengths? Perhaps one of my greatest strengths is that I know my weaknesses and how to deal with them. 
I am responsible and independent. That is, you can assign me any task and not worry about it.
I can work hard.  In my last job, I could also get calls at night or at weekends for any urgent tasks and have to give advice or fix problems remotely.
I can working with a team but I also enjoy working individually.
I'm not a conflicted person.
I'm honest. And I value my reputation.

### Pet project
Recently, my main pet project has been studying at RS School. I started my way from stage 0 in December 2021. 
The most technically challenging for me was the Virtual Keyboard project. It took me a while to figure out how best to do this task. Some of the nuances of the work I still have a question. Since the assignments go one by one, I did not have the time and energy to solve this issue until now. That said, the Virtual Keyboard was also one of the most interesting assignments. I did not sleep much, because I could not stop to solve the problem. The issue I had, among other things, was the problem of switching the language.
Another interesting assignments were the HTML Builder, and JS in the Shelter project (slider, random picture). 
It was interesting because I was able to apply knowledge in programming in a real project.
Not all tasks I did the first time, but if I knew there was something that didn't work (by myself or when someone pointed it out to me on the cross check), I fixed it.
There are tasks where I have difficulties - one of these is create a good design yourself. I know the difference between good and bad design and usability (I hope),  but it's hard for me to do well myself right now.

### Interest and free time
One of my hobbies has always been my work. I liked what I was doing. The same thing happens now, when I work on tasks in the RS School.
Now I don't have free time. But before, in my free time I liked to travel.
I like cycling. Listen to podcasts. Before the course, sometimes took part in the game like 'super quizz' 'Mozgoboynya'.

### Why I chose programming
I've always believed that a person should do what he likes. 
I really enjoy programming, creating new programs, finding problems and fixing them, solving complex problems with programs.

### In the end
I know exactly that I will become a software engineer, and I will do my best to reach my goal.

About my strengths.
Perhaps one of my greatest strengths is that I know my weaknesses and how to deal with them. 
I am responsible and independent. That is, you can assign me any task and not worry about it.
I can work hard.  In my last job, I could also get calls at night or on weekends for any urgent tasks and have to give advice or fix problems remotely. If I was passionate about a task, I could stay at work late into the night (it wasn't forbidden).
I think I could work under stress. (An example of this is that in my previous job I had to solve tasks very quickly in an environment where it depended on me how quickly the equipment would be up and running). 
I am attentive to detail. A program malfunction could damage equipment and cause a production stoppage.  
I can working with a team but I also enjoy working individually
I am a completely conflict-free person.
And also - I am honest. And I value my reputation.


(О моих сильных сторонах.
Возможно один из моих самых главных плюсов в том, что я знаю свои минусы и то, как с ними бороться. И теперь об остальном. 
Я ответственный и самостоятельный. Т.е. мне можно поручить какое-либо задание и не беспокоиться. 
Я могу работать тяжело.  На моей прошлой работе мне могли также звонить ночью или в выходные дни, для решения каких-либо срочных задач и мне приходилось давать консультации или устранять проблемы удаленно. Если я был увлечен решением какой-либо задачи, я мог оставаться на работе до поздней ночи (это не было запрещено).
Я думаю, что могу работать в условиях стресса. (Пример тому, что на предыдущей работе мне приходилось решать задачи очень быстро в условиях, когда от меня зависело насколько быстро будет запущено оборудование.) 
Я вниметелен к деталям. Неправильная работа программы могла повредить оборудование и привести к остановке производства.  
Я могу работать как в команде, так и один.
Я совершенно без конфликтный человек.
И еще - я честный. И я дорожу своей репутацией.)

### Pet project
В последнее время главным моим проектом была учеба в RS School.  Я начал свой путь с этапа 0. 
Самым сложным в техническом плане, для меня, был проект Виртуальной клавиатуры. У меня не сразу получилось понять, как лучше всего сделать это задание. Некоторые нюансы работы у меня вызывают вопрос до сих пор. Т.к. задания идут один за одним, у меня не было времени и сил решить этот вопрос до сих пор. При этом Виртуальная клавиатура была и одним из самых интересных заданий. Я мало спал, потому что не мог остановиться решать task. Вопрос который у меня возник, помимо прочего, это проблема при переключении языка.
Из интересных заданий так же стоит отнести HTML Builder, и JS в Shelter project (slider? random picture). 
Не все задания я делал с первого раза, но если я знал, что где-то есть нерабочие элементы (сам или когда мне об том указывали на кросс-чеке), то я переделывал их.
Во frontend мне тяжело - это  придумать самому хороший дизайн. Я могу оценить удобство и дизайн уже готового решения и отличить (я надеюсь) хороший от плохого. Но придумать что-то красивое самому  - сейчас это сложно и долго для меня. 

My main project lately has been studying at RS School.  I started my way from stage 0. 
The most technically challenging for me was the Virtual Keyboard project. It took me a while to figure out how best to do this task. Some of the nuances of the work I still have a question.

Not all tasks I did the first time, but if I knew there was something that didn't work (by myself or when someone pointed it out to me on the cross check), I redid it.
The hard part for me on the frontend is coming up with a good design myself. I can assess the usability and design of an existing solution and distinguish (I hope) good from bad. But to come up with something nice by myself - now it's hard and long for me. 

### Interest and free time
One of my hobbies has always been my work. I liked what I was doing. The same thing happens now, when I work on tasks in the RS School.

### Why I chose programming
I've always believed that a person should do what he likes. And if he tries hard, he'll be able to achieve his goal and make money doing what he likes.
I really enjoy programming, creating new programs, finding problems and fixing them, solving complex problems with programs.

### In the end
I know for sure that I will become a software engineer, and I will do my best to reach my go
